        <p>It was also a time when we stepped into the kitchen to <br>
           cook and look after ourselves. Multiple food trends came <br>
           to the fore: from Dalgona coffee to banana bread,and more. <br>
           And before we realised it,social media became a platform for <br>
           budding home-bakers, one-minute recipes, and many new food <br>
           bloggers. At that time me and my sister started to try recipes <br>
           with simple way.Cooking with minimal ingredients. shoot cooking <br>
           videos,click photos and post social site.Our main motto is simple <br>

          <h2 class="image-heading"> BIRIYANI</h2>
          <p class="image-content">The word “BIRYANI” comes from the Persian word “BIRYAN” which means “fried before cooking.”  One could conclude that the biryani originated in Iran (modern day Persia). Another interesting story traces the origins of the dish to Mumtaz Mahal(1593-1631), Shah Jahan’s queen who inspired the Taj Mahal. It is said that she once visited army barracks and found the army personnel under-nourished. She asked the chef to prepare a special dish which provided balanced nutrition, and thus the biryani was created.... ( Source: google )</P>

          <p class="image-content">Despite the dearth of evidence, it is believed that phirni hailed from ancient Middle East and it's the Mughals who both invented and introduced it to India. The Mughal Empire relished the regal milk-based dish and made it popular.Phirni also called as firni is a classic slow-cooked Indian sweet pudding made with basmati rice, milk, nuts, sugar and scented with cardamom powder or saffron or rose water. It is a must in festive occasions or special celebrations like Eid as well as for Diwali...(Source:google) </p>

          <p class="image-content">Idli are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils and rice.Gujarati historians believe that it was Saurashtrian textile merchants who introduced idli to South India during the 10th and 12th centuries. There are even claims that a mix of rice and black gram ground together and later steamed to form cakes had its origins in Gujarat...(Source:google) </p>

          <p class="image-content">The origins of the dish are unclear and remain disputed. Egg rolls are closely related to the spring rolls served in mainland China, and were first seen in the early 20th century in the United States. An early reference to egg rolls appeared in a 1917 Chinese recipe pamphlet published in the United States, but the dish does not resemble the modern egg roll.Andrew Coe, author of Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States, has stated that the modern American egg-roll in New york city.......(Source:google)</p>
